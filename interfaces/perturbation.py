    """Abstract base class for graph perturbations.

    A perturbation is any operation that modifies a graph in a controlled way.
    Examples include removing nodes, adding edges, removing edges, modifying
    node features, etc.

    Each concrete perturbation configures its own parameters (strategy, count,
    probability, etc.) in __init__. The apply method is stateless with respect
    to the graph argument.
